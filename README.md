### Example Code: Using List Comprehension

Here's a sneak peek into using list comprehensions for filtering data:

```python
# Example of list comprehension for filtering even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
